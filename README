Usage:

Run ‘weight-tracker add WEIGHT’ (in kilograms) every time you weigh yourself.
The script adds a timestamped entry to the database.

After you have a few entries, run ‘weight-tracker plot FILENAME.PNG’ to get a
nice graph.

To plot your body mass index:

mkdir -p ~/.config/weight-tracker
echo height=1.23 >~/.config/weight-tracker/config

where 1.23 is your height in meters.

Dependencies:

sqlite3, gnuplot
